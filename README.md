## About 

Curated list of articles, web-resources, tutorials, `Stack Overflow` and `Quora` Q&A, `GitHub`code repositories and useful resources that may help you dig a little bit deeper into iOS. All the resources are split into sub-categories which simlifies navigation and management. Feel free to use and suggest something to learn (iOS related of course ðŸ˜œ). 

You may see some non-directly related topics such as `Computer Graphics`, `Machine Learning` or `Design Patterns` - these are actually related, in some ways, to `iOS` development, but in a much broader and more specific way. With the addition of new materials, the structure of the document will be properly maintained meaning that it will become a reference book for learning. Happy evolving ðŸ¤“:octocat:
